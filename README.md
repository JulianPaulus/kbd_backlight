# kbd_backlight
Controls the keyboard backlight on Linux

Options:

-e

  Enable, set to 100%
  
-d

  Disable, set to 0%

-l <num>

  Set the level to <num> - must be between 0 and 100

This is hardcoded to use /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness.  If
your system does not use this file for backlight control, then this
program isn't for you.
